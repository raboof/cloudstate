# Assigning issues

Self-assign issues when you start work on them. If you would like to contribute
to an issue that has an assignee, coordinate with them. When you go offline
leaving the issue in a state where others can pick up your work you can signal
this by clearing your assignment.

# PR's

PR's can be merged by anyone when CI is green and there is at least one
approval.

As a reviewer, if you feel confident you can merge the issues you approve. You
can approve without merging when:

* CI has not finished yet
* you would like a second review
* you have small comments that need to be addressed, but approve the PR pending those
* you have optional comments for the author to consider

In those cases the original author (or another committer) can merge the PR later.

As PR author, if you want to share a PR but don't want it to be merged yet,
mark it as a 'Draft' PR.
